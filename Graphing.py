        If there is more than one such path, any of the paths is returned.

        Return None if no such path exists (i.e., if self is not connected to a vertex with

        True

        Implementation note (IMPORTANT):
            - Unlike check_connected, you should NOT mutate visited here (but instead
              create a new set that adds self, using set.union for example).
              This is less efficient, but also required to not introduce bugs.
              (Keep reading for details, but it's not required for implementing this method.)

              To see why, consider the doctest example.
              Since v1 has two neighbours (v2 and v3) stored in a set, the choice of which
              one to recurse on first is up to the Python interpreter. If we recurse on
              v2 first, then that recursive call will return False (since the path
              v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 is too long). But if we have every recursive call mutate
              visited, then when we're back to the original call v1.check_connected_distance,
              the loop will skip over v3, and fail to "find" the path v1, v3, v4, v5.

              This is subtle because this error would only happen if we make the first recursive
              call on v2---if we recurse on v3, the doctest would pass!
